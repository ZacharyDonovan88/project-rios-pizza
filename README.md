## User Story
AS A pizza bar buisness owner I WANT customers to be able to look at our website to view our menu items and deals WHEN the user opens the pizza icons I want them to see the ingredients and the prices

## Description
This is a local pizza bar website for my project 3 assignment. This is my 3rd repo for the same project, this repo is for me to focus on the front end.

On the navbar click the page you want to access. On the pizza page click any of the pizza icons to find out what the ingredients/prices are. Click the icon again to close the ingredients/prices.

To run locally, in terminal type and enter 'npm i'. Then type and run 'npm start'.
